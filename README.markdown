# What is it?

Github Watcher is a GTK+ desktop application that monitors your Github watch list and keeps a synced copy of each watched repository on your local machine.

# Is it ready?

Not really.  It does everything it is supposed to, up to a point.  I haven't got it all the way debugged, and to be honest it needs some re-writes because I was in a hurry the first time.  But it will download and sync your repos, just not consistently over a long period of time.
